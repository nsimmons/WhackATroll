Description
===========

WhackATroll is a simple "whack-a-mole" style game built using HTML5, node.js and Redis. 

Apparently someone already thought of this idea... [See here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whack-a-troll/id500917075?mt=8). But that doesn't really surprise me! If anything it makes me feel that my silly idea has been validated :)

Dependencies
===========

On the client side I am using [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) integrated with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) v1.8.3
 
Contributors
